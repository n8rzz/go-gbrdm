# GBRDM

**G**it **Br**anch **D**elete **M**ultiple.

Provides a CLI interface for deleting multiple local branches at the same time.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/n8rzz/go-gbrdm
```

## Usage

Navigate to a directory that contains a `.git` directory.

```bash
gbrdm
```

Select the branch(es) you'd like to remove

Confirm you really want to remove them


![confirm-you-want-to-delete-branches](assets/confirm-you-want-to-delete-branches.png)

And your done!

## Reserved Branches

You will notice that running `gbrdm` produces a list of _most_ of your local branches, but some may be missing.  There are several branch names that we won't include in group deleting.  These names are:

```bash
master
develop
test
staging
```

The reason for this is that the names above are commonly used for important branches.  You may still delete these branches if you choose, but you will need to do it outside of the `gbrdm` interface.
